"""Given two lists, find the smallest difference between any two nums.

For example, given the lists:

  {10, 20, 14, 16, 18}
  {30, 23, 54, 33, 96}

The result would be 3, since 23-20=3 is the smallest difference of any
pair of numbers in those lists.

IMPORTANT: you must solve this with an algorithm that is faster than
O(ab) -- that is, you cannot compare each item of list a against
each item of list b (that would be O(ab) time).
